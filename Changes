        Wasting my time debugging on MS Windows :(

1.02    18/07/2024-17:00
        After getting "free to wrong pool" on threaded Perls,
        I set a MyFree() function in XS code so as to
	free externally malloc'ed memory with libc's free()
        as per https://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=742205

1.03    10/10/2024
        Refreshed.

1.04    22/10/2024
        The comment in the function signature of file
        String-Random-Regexp-regxstring.xs (function
        generate_random_strings_xs) caused trouble with
        latest Perl versions (e.g. 5.41.5).
        I have removed the C-style comment
        in the XS function signature and that
        keeps the XS compiler happy for newer Perl versions.
        Added SEE ALSO in documentation.
